- should I separate depth handling from blend mode?

- clearColor is handled differently between MetalView and offscreen snapshot for preview

- If the requested texture is not available, don't crash

- loop music playback

- keypress not being detected

- document: iFrame == -1 is the preview?

- how do I get alpha in the running version of the shader?

// ========================================================

- Make an editor so that I can create cellular automata inputs (like the find-islands problem)

- I will want to import meshes generated by Blender or Mathematica
